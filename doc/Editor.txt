SDLPoP built-in editor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea to include an editor in SDLPoP being out there heaps of editors and tools is to allow live editing of the game. It also allows developers to change defined constants in the game (changing level size) to extend it and still having a working editor to create mods.

The concept is different to other editors. It is based on the game, so learning how to edit is different from other editors: users will have to learn more key codes in order to edit the levels.
