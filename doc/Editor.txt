SDLPoP built-in editor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea to include an editor in SDLPoP being out there heaps of editors and tools is to allow live editing of the game. It also allows developers to change defined constants in the game (changing level size) to extend it and still having a working editor to create mods.

The concept is different to other editors. It is based on the game, so learning how to edit is different from other editors: users will have to learn more key codes in order to edit the levels.

By pressing Shift the mouse pointer indicates where the characters will be placed. Using Ctrl-Alt door linking showing features are activated: Blue tiles are not linkable, red tiles are linkable (doors and buttons), the number displayed indicates how many links this tile has.

The copied message:

When a single tile is copied the following text is displayed:
COPIED FG:tile_code/extra BG:mod

Where tile_code is the code of the tile (a number between 0 and 31). Extra is the high part of the tile (normally could be ignored).
mod is the modifier, it depends on the tile.

When a multiple tile block is copied the following text is displayed:
COPIED FG:tile_code/extra+tile_code/extraPos BG:mod+mod
same as above, but for the two tiles. Pos is where the extra tile is located: A for above, B for below, L for left and R for right.


TODO List/known bugs:
* Undo/Redo features fails syncing with current game door links
* Copy/paste does nothing with the room linking functionality, creating duplicated buttons.
* Adding buttons won't set up the modifier to 255, which is used as a "non-event" button.
* Selection using the palette room 8 redrawn.
* Automatic decoration of room.
* Multiple select on room (up to 30 tiles) using ctrl+click or dragging
* Drag rooms/groups of rooms on map
