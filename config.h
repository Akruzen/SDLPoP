// Bugfixes:

// If a room is linked to itself on the left, the closing sounds of the gates in that room can't be heard.
//#define FIX_GATE_SOUNDS

// An open gate or chomper may enable the Kid to go through walls. (Trick 7, 37, 62)
//#define FIX_TWO_COLL_BUG

// If a room is linked to itself at the bottom, and the Kid's column has no floors, the game hangs.
//#define FIX_INFINITE_DOWN_BUG

// When a gate is under another gate, the top of the bottom gate is not visible.
// But this fix causes a drawing bug when a gate opens.
//#define FIX_GATE_DRAWING_BUG

// When climbing up to a floor with a big pillar top behind, turned right, Kid sees through floor.
// The current fix causes glitches you can see on bug_chomper.PNG and bug_climb.PNG .
